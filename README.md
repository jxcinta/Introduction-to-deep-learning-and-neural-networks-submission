# Introduction-to-deep-learning-and-neural-networks-submission
This was my submission for the Introduction to deep learning and neural networks course by IBM on Coursera for the AI engineering certificate. 
The purpose of this task was to build a regression model around data that concerned the production of concrete and what variables increased it's strength. 
To do this the Keras library was used and I had to experiment with increasing the number of training epochs and changing number of hidden layers to see how these parameters 
impacts the performance of the model.
